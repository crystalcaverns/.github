# Crystal Caverns

Reinventing how you enjoy Minecraft. Powered by nvias.org

During the development of Crystal Caverns, we make a ton of code, some of which gets replaced or is never used. You can find all of the deprecated and unused code we're ever made right here, all in neat little packages. Please note that this code may not be upkept by us and might not work very well. Still, hopefully someone (maybe you!) can learn from our successes and especially our mistakes. The code we currently use may eventually get here as well, but we cannot share most of it due to security concerns.
